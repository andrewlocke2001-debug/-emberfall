# EMBERFALL — Progress Log

Living log. Update at the end of every session: what shipped, decisions made,
next up. This file is how any session (or month-long absence) knows exactly
where the project stands.

## Current phase

**P0 — Foundation (deploy only).** Everything local is done and verified:
netcode, combat slice, real-database persistence, tests, CI workflow, deploy
configs. The single remaining item is the deploy itself, which needs the
user's accounts — full runbook in `design/DEPLOY.md`.

## Next up (in order)

1. **Deploy session** (user + Claude Code together): GitHub remote → Neon
   Postgres (+ provider swap per DEPLOY.md §2) → Fly.io server → Netlify
   client → P0 exit test on two phones over the real internet
2. Then P1: Tiled maps (Meadowbrook/Greenreach), auth, zod validation, chat

## Shipped

### 2026-06-10 — P0 production plumbing ✅
- **Prisma 7 persistence** replaces the JSON snapshot store: `Player` table,
  SQLite locally (`server/prisma/dev.db`, no Docker needed), driver-adapter
  setup (`@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3`), `db:migrate`/`db:studio`/
  `db:deploy`/`db:generate` scripts, root `postinstall` generates the client.
  Async store with fault-tolerant snapshot writes. All tests green against
  the DB (14 unit + 2 e2e incl. reconnect persistence).
- **git repo initialized**, initial commit; `.gitignore` covers env/db/
  generated client.
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — typecheck + unit tests on push.
- **Deploy prep:** `server/Dockerfile` (workspace-aware, migrate-on-boot),
  `fly.toml`, `.dockerignore`, `server/.env.example`, runbook at
  `design/DEPLOY.md`. Client already reads `VITE_SERVER_URL`.
- New runtime deps (rule 9): `@prisma/client` + `@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3`
  (persistence), `tsx` moved to deps (prod runtime executes TS directly).
  Dev deps: `prisma`, `dotenv` (prisma.config.ts env loading).

### 2026-06-09 — M0/P0 local slice ✅
- npm-workspaces monorepo (`shared`/`server`/`client`), strict TS everywhere
- Colyseus 0.17 zone room: 20 Hz authoritative sim, movement intents
  validated/clamped server-side, tab-target ability vs training dummy
- Phaser 3 client: prediction + reconciliation (local), interpolation
  (remote), nameplates, health bars, click-to-target, R to attack
- Reconnect restores character (JSON snapshot store, keyed by playerId)
- 14 Vitest unit tests (combat/movement) + 2 Playwright e2e (two-player sync,
  persistence); typecheck clean across all workspaces

### 2026-06-10 — Design reconciliation ✅
- Emberfall starter kit (7/9 docs recovered) merged into `design/`:
  GDD, ROADMAP (P0–P12 + exit criteria), INSPIRATION_MAP, WORKFLOW, this log,
  and repo `CLAUDE.md`. Kit's BOOTSTRAP is obsolete (scaffold exists);
  kit's ARCHITECTURE.md was not recovered and is superseded by the working
  repo + CLAUDE.md rules.

## Decision log

- **2026-06-10 — REAL-TIME 20 Hz LOCKED** over the kit's 600ms OSRS tick.
  Criteria: most popular modern combat model, least clunky, netcode already
  built and verified; deliberate pacing via ~1.5s GCD (FFXIV), not input
  quantization. Do not reopen.
- **2026-06-10** — Classless skills (8 launch skills, RS-style) supersede the
  M0 `ClassId` placeholder; refactor lands with P2 combat core.
- **2026-06-09** — Colyseus schema via `defineTypes()` + `declare` fields
  (NOT `@type` decorators — tsx/esbuild emits TC39 decorators that crash
  Colyseus). See CLAUDE.md gotchas.
- **2026-06-09** — Phaser pinned to v3 (^3.90) for consistency with the
  user's other projects; npm resolves v4 by default — don't upgrade casually.
- **2026-06-09** — Persistence M0 = JSON snapshots (zero native deps on
  Windows); Prisma/Postgres is the P0-remainder upgrade.

## Known bugs / debt

- Zone is the placeholder `verdant-vale` open grid — replaced by Tiled
  Meadowbrook/Greenreach in P1 (rename `zoneId` then).
- No inbound-message schema validation yet beyond clamping — zod lands P1.
- Migrations are SQLite-flavored; the Postgres swap (provider + adapter-pg +
  regenerated init migration) happens at the deploy session — DEPLOY.md §2.
- Headless-Chromium WebGL doesn't paint into screenshots; `?canvas=1` query
  flag forces the Canvas renderer for visual capture (used by e2e).
