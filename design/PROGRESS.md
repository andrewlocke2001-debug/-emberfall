# EMBERFALL — Progress Log

Living log. Update at the end of every session: what shipped, decisions made,
next up. This file is how any session (or month-long absence) knows exactly
where the project stands.

## Current phase

**P0 CLOSED ✅ (desktop-verified 2026-06-14)** — user played the live game at
https://emberfall-server.fly.dev on desktop: spawns, moves, world renders.
The hard part (real-time authoritative multiplayer over the internet) is
proven. One URL serves client + websocket (no Netlify). Single Fly machine
(keep at 1 until P11 Redis).

**Now: P1 — "A world worth standing in."** Done: P1.1 (zod validation),
P1.2 (ASCII→Tiled maps + collision), mobile touch controls, **P1.3 complete**
— real Meadowbrook/Greenreach rendered in-game with collision; map-driven
spawns/dummies; **zone travel** (one Colyseus room per zone; stepping on a
gate sends a Transfer → client re-boots into the target zone at the named
entry; Player.zone persisted; arrival spawns at the entry, blocked/cross-zone
saved positions fall back to the default entry). 34 unit + 2 e2e green.
**P1 COMPLETE (local).** Done: P1.1 zod validation, P1.2 maps+collision,
mobile touch controls, P1.3 zones+travel, P1.4 accounts/auth (argon2 + JWT,
guest + login/register), **P1.5 chat** — zone + global broadcast, obscenity
profanity filter, 5/10s rate limit, DOM chat UI (channel toggle, focus pauses
movement) + zone HUD (name + player count); global chat crosses rooms via a
process-local EventEmitter bus (Redis swap-in seam for P11). 38 unit + 4 e2e
green; typecheck clean.

The kit's P1 exit ("two people meet in town, talk, walk to Greenreach
together, log out, come back") is functionally met — verified locally, NOT
yet on real devices because we're not deployed.

## P1.6 close-out — remaining
- **Deploy** (blocked): Fly trial ended; add a card (~$0–5/mo) → redeploy →
  on-device P1 exit test. Everything since the empty-grid version is local-only.

## P2 — combat core (in progress, local)
- **P2.1 done**: stat-based combat math (hitChance/maxHit/resolveAttack) + XP
  curve + skill→stat helpers, pure & tested.
- **P2.2 done**: mob roster (emberling/wolf/bandit + passive dummy) spawned
  from map markers; mob AI (aggro/chase/attack-on-cadence/leash-home);
  players take damage, die → respawn at the zone entry; mobs respawn home;
  client mob colors + dead-dimming + death banner. Greenreach is now
  dangerous; Meadowbrook stays safe. 51 unit + 5 e2e green (new mob-aggro e2e).
- **P2.3 done**: 3 data-driven abilities (Strike, Power Strike, Mend) with an
  Energy resource (+regen), a ~1.5s global cooldown + per-ability cooldowns
  (server-authoritative); strike/power are stat-based (resolveAttack), Mend is
  an off-GCD self-heal. Client ability bar (energy meter, cooldown sweeps,
  keys 1/2/3 + click/tap, Space = Strike) + green heal numbers. 51 unit + 6
  e2e green (new energy-spend e2e).
- **P2.4 done**: XP, leveling & **shared kill credit** (GW2-style). Two skills
  now live on the synced PlayerSchema as XP totals (`meleeXp`, `vitalityXp`);
  Melee level (= `level`) drives combat stats, Vitality level drives maxHp
  (a Vitality level-up raises maxHp and heals by the gain). Every player who
  lands a hit on a mob is tagged a contributor; on death ALL contributors get
  full XP (`gainXp` on the shared RS curve) — no last-hit stealing. Level-ups
  send a `LevelUp` message → gold client toast; HUD shows ⚔/♥ levels. XP
  persists (Prisma `add_skills` migration: `meleeXp`/`vitalityXp` Int default 0,
  applied to Neon via `migrate deploy`). 56 unit + 6 e2e green; typecheck clean.
- **P2.5 done**: **bot harness** + **GM commands v1** — closes the P2 combat
  core (local).
  - **Bots** (`npm run bots -- --count 50`): `tools/bots.ts`, headless Colyseus
    SDK clients that guest-auth, join a zone, and send the *same* move/strike
    intents a browser does (server can't tell them apart). Flags: `--count`,
    `--zone` (default greenreach), `--server`, `--duration`. Auto-reconnect,
    staggered connects, periodic stats, graceful SIGINT shutdown. Smoke-verified
    4 bots connecting + fighting locally. (Debt: each bot makes a guest account;
    big runs need a throwaway Neon branch.)
  - **GM commands** (`/heal [name]`, `/tp <x> <y>`, `/spawn <kind>`, `/kick
    <name>`): role-gated by the `GM_USERNAMES` env allowlist (no DB column —
    a client can never grant itself GM), parsed by pure shared helpers
    (`@mmo/shared/systems/gm`), executed server-authoritatively in ZoneRoom,
    audit-logged to the server console. Slash messages are intercepted before
    the chat path (never broadcast); non-GMs get a private refusal. Replies use
    a "System" chat line (reuses chat UI). 63 unit + 8 e2e green (new gm.spec:
    GM spawns a mob / non-GM is blocked).
- **P2 combat core COMPLETE (local).** Remaining P2 exit step is a *manual*
  load soak: 50 bots for an hour without server degradation (run once deploy is
  unblocked / against a throwaway DB).

## P3 — items, inventory, loot (in progress, local)
- **P3.1 done**: item model + inventory system + **economy ledger** foundation.
  - `shared/data/items.ts` — typed item roster (rarity, maxStack, value, equip
    slot, bonuses, heal); starter set (coins, bronze/iron sword, leather body,
    bronze helm, health potion, materials). `shared/systems/inventory.ts` — pure
    28-slot stacking add/remove/count/canAdd (10 unit tests).
  - Inventory is delivered to its owner via a private `Inventory` message (NOT
    synced ZoneState — bags aren't broadcast to everyone). Server holds the
    authoritative per-session inventory, loads it on join, persists on
    leave/snapshot (Prisma `inventory` JSONB column).
  - **Economy ledger** (`LedgerEntry` table + `persistence/ledger.ts`): every
    item create/destroy appends a row (kit rule #6). First creation path is GM
    `/give <itemId> [qty]` (audited, `reason: "gm_give"`).
  - Client: DOM inventory panel (toggle **I**), 28-slot grid with rarity tints +
    qty badges. Migration `add_inventory_and_ledger` applied to Neon. 73 unit +
    10 e2e green (new inventory.spec: GM /give + reload-persistence).
- **P3.2 done**: equipment slots + **stat application**.
  - `shared/systems/equipment.ts` — pure equip/unequip (bag↔slots, with swap) +
    `equipmentBonus` (sums attack/strength/defence/maxHp of worn gear); 9 unit
    tests. 8 slots (weapon/head/body/legs/hands/feet/ring/amulet).
  - Equipment is server-authoritative, off synced state (private `Equipment`
    message like inventory), persisted as a Prisma JSONB column. Equip/unequip
    are validated zod messages; the server recomputes maxHp (Vitality curve +
    gear) on every change, and combat now uses **effective stats** (gear
    bonuses) for the player as both attacker and defender.
  - Client: equipment strip in the inventory panel; click a bag item to equip,
    click a worn item to unequip. Migration `add_equipment`. 82 unit + 11 e2e
    green (new equipment.spec: equip body armor → maxHp +6 → unequip restores).
- **P3.3 done**: drop tables + ground loot + coin drops (**personal loot**).
  - `shared/systems/loot.ts` — pure `rollDrops` (per-entry chance + uniform qty,
    injected RNG; 5 unit tests). Each mob has a `drops` table in data/mobs.ts
    (coins + materials; bandit rarely a sword/potion; dummy nothing).
  - On death, **every contributor gets their own loot roll** (GW2-style, no
    steals) → `GroundLootSchema` piles in synced state at the mob, reserved to
    that player (`ownerId`/`ownerUntil`) for 60s, then public; despawn at 120s.
  - Pickup (`Pickup` zod message): server checks range + ownership, adds to the
    bag, and **ledgers the item into the economy on pickup** (reason `loot`) —
    unpicked loot that despawns is a non-event (nothing entered an inventory).
  - Client renders clickable loot piles; GM `/droploot <item> [qty]` for
    testing. No DB migration (ground loot is transient). 87 unit + 12 e2e green.
- **P3.4 done**: **town bank** + P3 close-out.
  - `shared/systems/bank.ts` — pure deposit/withdraw between bag and bank (round
    trip conserves totals; 7 unit tests). `addItem` generalized with a slot-cap
    arg so the 240-slot bank reuses it. Bank locations are data
    (`shared/data/banks.ts` + `nearBank`); Meadowbrook's is in the plaza.
  - Bank is server-authoritative, off synced state (private `Bank` message),
    persisted as a Prisma JSONB column. Deposit/Withdraw are zod messages,
    **gated by proximity to a bank** server-side. Bag↔bank is a transfer, so
    it's **not** ledgered — the ledger stays balanced.
  - Client: bank marker in town + a two-column bank panel (toggle **B** at a
    bank; click to deposit/withdraw). Migration `add_bank`. 94 unit + 13 e2e.
- **P3 COMPLETE (local).** Items, inventory, equipment+stats, loot/drops, and
  the bank all ship; the economy ledger has tracked every create/destroy since
  the first item. P3 exit ("kill → loot upgrade → hit harder → bank the rest")
  is mechanically in place.
- Also wrote `design/STORY.md` (the Main Story spine + lore) on 2026-06-19.

## P4 — skilling (in progress, local)
- **P4.1 done**: **Gathering — Mining + Fishing**.
  - Two new skills (`mining`, `fishing`) added to SKILL_IDS; XP synced on
    PlayerSchema (`miningXp`/`fishingXp`) + persisted (migration
    `add_gathering_skills`). Gathered ore/fish items added to data/items.ts.
  - Resource nodes are data (`shared/data/resources.ts`: defs + per-zone
    placements + `nearBank`-style lookup) — per-player and non-depleting, so
    they need no synced schema (client renders from data, server validates
    against it), mirroring the bank pattern. Meadowbrook has starter copper/tin
    rocks + a pond shrimp spot; Greenreach has more + iron + a trout spot.
  - `Gather` is a zod message; the server runs a ~2.4–3s timed gather that
    **auto-repeats** while you stand still in range (RS semi-AFK feel), yields
    one item per cycle (**ledgered**, reason `gather`), grants skill XP, and
    stops on move / out-of-range / full bag / level-too-low. Nodes gate on a
    minimum skill level.
  - Client: clickable node markers; HUD now shows ⚔/♥/⛏/🎣 levels; mining/
    fishing level-up toasts. 94 unit + 14 e2e (new gather.spec: /tp to the
    copper rock → mine → ore + Mining XP).
- **P4.2 done**: **Crafting — Smithing + Cooking + food healing**.
  - Two crafting skills (`smithing`, `cooking`) added; XP synced + persisted
    (migration `add_crafting_skills`). New items: bronze/iron bars, cooked
    shrimp/trout (with `heal`). Recipes are data (`shared/data/recipes.ts`):
    smelt bronze/iron, forge bronze sword/helm, cook shrimp/trout.
  - Pure `craft()` system (consume inputs → output, refuse if missing/full; 4
    unit tests). `Craft` is an instant zod message — server checks level + runs
    the pure craft, **ledgers inputs destroyed + output created** (rule #6),
    grants skill XP. `Consume` (eat) removes 1 food, heals up to maxHp (green
    +N), ledgered.
  - Client: crafting panel (toggle **C**) listing recipes with craftability;
    click a food item in the bag to eat it; HUD adds 🔨/🍳. The full
    gather→craft→eat loop works. 98 unit + 16 e2e (new craft.spec: smelt bronze
    bar + Smithing XP; cook shrimp + eat it).
  - **P4 exit met (mechanically)**: a new player can mine ore, smith a bronze
    sword, cook a fish, and take it into combat — zero drops required.
- **P4.3 done**: **rested XP** (WoW-style). Logged-off time banks a credit
  buffer (`restedAccrual`, +500/hr capped 10k) that adds **+50% XP** to every
  skill award until spent (`restedBonus`); both pure + unit-tested. `restedXp`
  synced + persisted (migration `add_rested_xp`); accrued on join from the prior
  `lastSeen` (loadOrCreate now reads-then-writes so it can see the old
  timestamp). Applied to all XP grants (combat + gathering + crafting). HUD shows
  a 💤 rested indicator. 103 unit + 16 e2e.
- **P4 COMPLETE (local)** — gathering, crafting, food healing, rested XP.

## P5 — quests, NPCs, vendors (in progress, local)
- **P5.1 done**: **quest framework** + quest log UI. Quests are data
  (`shared/data/quests.ts`: kill/collect/talk objectives, rewards, prereq
  chains). Pure quest system (`systems/quests.ts`: accept/canAccept/recordKill/
  objectiveStatus/questReady/completeQuest; 6 unit tests). Per-player quest log
  synced via a `Quests` message + persisted (migration `add_quests`). Server
  handles accept/complete (zod), advances kill objectives on mob death, checks
  collect objectives live vs the bag at turn-in, then consumes collect items +
  pays rewards (coins/items/XP) — all ledgered. Client quest log panel
  (toggle **J**) with live objective progress + accept/turn-in. 109 unit + 17
  e2e (new quest.spec). `talk` objectives + quest-givers wired in P5.2.
- **P5.2 done**: **NPCs + dialogue + quest-givers**. NPCs are data
  (`shared/data/npcs.ts`: placement + greeting + offered quests); Warden Mira +
  Dorin the Smith stand in Meadowbrook. `Talk` is a proximity-gated zod message;
  `recordTalk` (pure, tested) completes `talk` objectives. Client renders NPC
  markers; clicking opens a dialogue panel (greeting + accept/turn-in/status for
  that NPC's quests). No migration (talk uses the existing quest log). 110 unit
  + 18 e2e (new npc.spec). Full branching dialogue trees deferred (v1 =
  greeting + quest options).
- **P5.3 done**: **vendors** (coin faucet + sink). Vendors are data
  (`shared/data/vendors.ts`); Trader Bram in Meadowbrook sells potions/food/
  basic gear. Pure pricing (`systems/shop.ts`: buy = value, sell = 40% of value;
  3 unit tests). `Buy`/`Sell` are proximity-gated zod messages; the server
  checks coins/stock/space, moves coins↔items, and ledgers both sides (reasons
  `buy`/`sell`). Client shop panel (click a vendor) with Buy/Sell columns + a
  coin readout. No migration. 113 unit + 19 e2e (new vendor.spec).
- **P5.4 done**: **starter quest arc** + content-integrity test. Added
  `supper_for_the_inn` (fish→cook) and the spotlight capstone `the_ember_scar`
  (kill a bandit + collect ash pelts → 200c + an iron sword), forming a coherent
  Mira/Dorin arc: greet → mine → cook → smith/cull → spotlight. New
  `data/content.test.ts` validates every cross-reference (items/mobs/npcs/
  vendors/recipes/nodes/quests). 119 unit + 19 e2e.
- **P5 COMPLETE (local)** — quests, NPCs/dialogue, vendors, a starter arc.
  Deferred (need deploy + real people, or a later content pass): the soft-launch
  with 10 strangers (P5 exit, blocked on deploy); branching dialogue trees;
  expanding the arc toward the GDD's 25-quest target.

## P6 — social fabric (in progress, local)
- **P6.1 done**: **whispers** (private DMs). `/w <name> <text>` in chat (or the
  `Whisper` zod message). The sender's room censors + rate-limits (shared chat
  throttle), echoes to the sender, and publishes on the globalBus; whichever
  room holds the named recipient delivers — so whispers cross zones. Purple
  `[w] from » to:` lines in chat. No migration. 119 unit + 20 e2e (new
  whisper.spec: cross-context delivery + sender echo).
- **P6.2 done**: **friends list + presence**. Persisted per-player friends
  (JSON column, migration `add_friends`, capped 50, must name a real
  character). New process-local `presence` service (name → zone; registered on
  join, guard-unregistered on leave so zone transfers can't wipe it) — the
  second Redis seam for P11. `FriendAdd`/`FriendRemove`/`RequestFriends` zod
  messages → a `Friends` push with live online/zone per entry. Client friends
  panel (toggle **F**): add-by-name, green/grey presence dots, per-row remove.
  119 unit + 21 e2e (new friends.spec: add → online in meadowbrook → remove).
- **P6.3 done**: **parties + shared kill XP**. Pure `PartyRegistry` in
  `shared/systems/party.ts` (invite/accept/leave; cap 5; leader promotion;
  disband at 1; 5 unit tests) instanced once process-wide
  (`services/party.ts`). Invites require the target online; the invitee gets a
  System whisper + a roster push (`partyChanged` on the globalBus fans roster
  updates to whichever rooms hold the members — parties survive zone travel
  and brief relogs; members show offline via presence). **Shared XP**: on a
  mob death, party members of any tagger who are in the same zone, alive, and
  within PARTY_LEVEL_RANGE (10) melee levels get full kill XP + quest kill
  credit; **loot rolls stay tag-based**. Client party panel (toggle **P**):
  invite-by-name, accept banner, leader crown, presence, leave. 124 unit + 22
  e2e (new party.spec: invite → accept → shared roster → leave disbands).
- **P6.4 done**: **guilds v1** (durable). New `Guild` table (unique name +
  [TAG], leaderId) + `Player.guildId/guildRank` (migration `add_guilds`).
  Pure rules in `shared/systems/guild.ts` (name/tag validation, canKick,
  canSetRank; 4 unit tests). Create/invite/accept/leave/kick/set-rank are zod
  messages; invites are transient (target must be online, System whisper +
  panel refresh); leader leaving hands off to an officer (else first member);
  the last member out disbands (guild deleted). Rooms cache membership per
  session (DB is truth; `guildChanged` on the bus triggers a DB re-read +
  push; snapshots deliberately never write membership so a kick can't be
  clobbered). **Guild chat**: chat channel cycles zone→global→guild; guild
  lines fan out members-only via the bus. Client guild panel (toggle **G**):
  found form, accept banner, roster with 👑/⭐ ranks + presence, promote/
  demote + kick (rank-gated), leave. 128 unit + 23 e2e (new guild.spec: found
  → invite/accept → guild chat → disband).
- **P6.5 done**: **public hiscores**. The game server serves `/hiscores`
  (server-rendered, crawlable HTML — no client bundle) and `/api/hiscores`
  (JSON): top 50 per skill + a total-level board (ordered by summed XP; levels
  derived with the shared curve). Names HTML-escaped; read-only queries.
  128 unit + 24 e2e (new hiscores.spec: JSON rows ranked + HTML page).
- **P6 COMPLETE (local)** — whispers, friends+presence, parties+shared XP,
  guilds v1 + guild chat, public hiscores. The P6 exit ("a 4-person party
  quests for an hour; a guild of strangers exists that you didn't create")
  needs real players — deferred with the deploy, same as the P5 soft launch.

## P7 — Cinder Depths + Tanglewood (in progress, local)
- **P7.1 done**: **Tanglewood** — the level 20–40 forest east of Greenreach
  (60×60; dense tree corridors, old Accord ruins, a wraith pond). Greenreach's
  road now runs its full width to a new east gate; travel is
  meadowbrook ⇄ greenreach ⇄ tanglewood. Three new mob families in data:
  **Thorn Stalker** (20), **Ruin Sentinel** (30, armored, drops iron bars +
  rarely an **Ancient Relic** — new rare vendor-treasure item), **Ember
  Wraith** (38, fast hitter). Gathering: two iron rocks in the north glade + a
  guarded trout pool. mapgen gained chars t/r/m; maps.test now covers all
  three zones. 132 unit + 24 e2e; no migration (pure content).
- **P7.2 done**: **Cinder Depths — instanced dungeon**. New 40×40 dungeon map
  under the Tanglewood ruins (linear crawl; boss arena reserved for P7.3), a
  gate in the ruins and a south gate back out. Zones now split into overworld
  `ZONE_IDS` (one persistent room each) vs instanced `DUNGEON_IDS`; `mapForId`
  resolves either. The dungeon reuses `ZoneRoom` but is registered
  `.filterBy(["ticket"])`, so each party (or solo) gets its own instance. A
  server `dungeons` ticket service mints one unguessable ticket per party at
  the gate (shared by member signature within a TTL); `onJoin` rejects anyone
  the ticket doesn't name. Persistence rewrites a dungeon location to the
  overworld return entry, so a relog never strands in a dead instance;
  `maxClients` = party size. `TransferPayload.ticket` carries it into the join;
  the client renders dungeon maps (`mapForId`) and clears stale tickets on
  overworld travel. 136 unit + 25 e2e (new dungeon.spec: gate → distinct
  instanced room → return). No migration.
- **P7.3 done**: **dungeon boss — Warden of Ash** with **telegraphed attacks**.
  New boss mob (2400 HP, `boss:true`) holding the Cinder Depths north arena
  with two adds. `MobDef.telegraph` (windup/radius/damage/cooldown) drives a
  dodgeable AoE slam: the boss roots, `EnemySchema` streams the danger circle
  (teleAt/teleX/teleY/teleRadius), and on landing every player still inside
  takes the hit — move out and it whiffs. Cleared on death/respawn so a dead
  boss never slams. Client renders a pulsing red danger circle at the telegraph.
  Run reward = the boss drop table: guaranteed coins + 2–4 Ancient Relics and a
  50% **Cinderheart Amulet** (new relic-tier amulet, best neck slot). mapgen
  gained the `W` boss char. 136 unit + 26 e2e (new boss.spec: telegraph winds
  up, slam damages a standing player). No migration.
- Next: **P7.4** dungeon close-out (loot/reward polish, lockout or repeatable
  tuning) or **P8**.

## Single-player build (play-test track, alongside the roadmap)
- **Client-only solo mode** so the game is play-testable for free (Fly trial
  ended): `net/localRoom.ts` runs the whole game in-browser against the SAME
  shared systems + schema as the server ZoneRoom — movement/collision, combat,
  abilities, mob AI + boss telegraphs, death/respawn, loot, inventory,
  equipment, gather, craft, bank, quests, NPCs, vendors, zone travel + the
  instanced dungeon — persisting one character to localStorage. `net/mode.ts`
  `SOLO` (VITE_SOLO=1 at build, or `?solo` at runtime) makes `connectToZone`
  return a `SoloRoom` and `main.ts` skip login. Sandbox chat commands in solo:
  `/give /tp /spawn /heal`. Verified by `solo.spec` (runs, /give, equip→maxHp,
  mine ore, reload-persist) + full typecheck; the solo prod build succeeds.
- **Deploy**: `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds the solo client
  (VITE_SOLO=1; vite base "./" already handles the /-emberfall/ subpath) and
  publishes to GitHub Pages → a shareable static link, $0. Removed
  `keepwarm.yml` (was pinging the dead Fly server every 5 min and emailing
  failures); scoped `ci.yml` to `main`.
- Also added a GM `/clearbag` command + `clearBag()` e2e helper so the shared
  GameMaster fixture's 28-slot bag can be reset (it had filled over the session,
  flaking the add-an-item tests).

## P8 — the economy (in progress, local)
- **P8.1 done**: **durability + repair** (a gold sink). Gear has `maxDurability`
  (`shared/systems/durability.ts`: hasDurability/wear/isBroken/repairCost/
  currentDurability/effectiveEquipment, 7 unit tests). Per-item durability
  (`{itemId: remaining}`) is tracked off synced state, persisted (JSONB column,
  migration `add_durability`). A landing swing wears the weapon; taking a hit
  wears a random armor piece; **broken gear (0) grants no bonus** (via
  effectiveEquipment in playerStats/maxHpFor). Repair all worn gear for coins at
  a vendor (`Repair` msg, ledgered sink) — button in the shop panel. Durability
  shown per gear slot in the equipment panel (worn/BROKEN styling). Fully
  mirrored in the solo engine. 143 unit + 28 e2e (new durability.spec: wear in
  combat → repair at vendor). Also fixed a stuck-dead GameMaster e2e fixture
  (enterWorldAsGm now `/heal`s on entry) — cleared 7 cascading failures.
- **P8.2 done**: **secure player-to-player trade**. Pure state machine
  (`shared/systems/trade.ts`, 4 tests) enforcing the confirm-twice invariant:
  ANY offer change clears BOTH confirmations. Server manages per-room trade
  sessions: request (proximity-gated, by name) → accept → each side sets a full
  offer (validated they hold it) → confirm-twice → **atomic swap** (re-validate
  holdings + bag space; all-or-nothing) with paired ledger entries (reason
  "trade", nets to zero = audit trail). Torn down on leave/death/zone-travel.
  Client trade panel (toggle **T**): request-by-name, accept/decline banner,
  your/their offers, add-from-bag + coins, confirm/cancel; auto-opens on a
  request. Solo: friendly "no one else here" message. 147 unit + 29 e2e (new
  trade.spec: GM trades a sword to a guest, confirm-twice, atomic swap).
- **P8.3 done**: **the Exchange** — an async order-book market. Pure matching
  engine (`shared/systems/exchange.ts`, 6 tests): price-time priority,
  executes at the RESTING order's price (takers get price improvement), plus
  the 2% tax math (`EXCHANGE_TAX_RATE`). Durable book in Prisma
  (`ExchangeOrder` escrowed orders with `*ToCollect` buckets for offline
  fills; `ExchangeTrade` price history; migration `add_exchange`).
  Post (at the vendor/clerk, proximity-gated): sell escrows items, buy escrows
  qty×price coins (overflow-capped; max 8 open orders). Fills settle async:
  seller accrues net-of-tax coins, buyer accrues items + any price-improvement
  refund; the tax is ledgered (`exchange_tax`) as the sink. Collect moves
  what fits into the bag; cancel refunds unfilled escrow + pending collection;
  fully-settled orders vanish. Client Exchange panel (toggle **X**): post
  form, my orders with fill state + Collect/Cancel, recent-prices lookup.
  Solo: friendly multiplayer-only message. 153 unit + 30 e2e (new
  exchange.spec: post→escrow→match→collect with 2% tax→price history→cancel
  refund).
- **P8.4 done**: **economy dashboard**. `/economy` (HTML) + `/api/economy`
  (JSON) aggregate the ledger: coin faucets vs sinks by reason (created −
  destroyed = circulation) and per-item supply (the dupe canary). Optional
  `ECONOMY_KEY` gate for prod; open in dev. 153 unit + 31 e2e (economy.spec).
- **P8 COMPLETE (local)** — durability+repair, secure trade, the Exchange
  (order book + 2% tax), economy dashboard. Exit criterion (a player gets
  rich trading; flat gold supply) needs real players — deferred with deploy.

## Play-test build note (2026-07-09)
- The repo is still private, so the GitHub Pages link can't serve. Delivered
  instead: `tools/singlefile.mjs` + `SINGLEFILE=1` build → `emberfall-solo.html`
  (one ~1.4MB self-contained file, runs from file://, verified headless) —
  sent directly to the user for sharing with friends.

## P9 — opt-in danger (complete, local)
- **P9.1 duels**: consensual PvP via DuelRequest/Respond (proximity, no item
  loss); UseAbility accepts a player target only inside an active duel; death
  announced + normal respawn; torn down on leave/death/travel; GM `/sethp`.
- **P9.2 the Ashreach**: new 50×50 PvP risk zone north of Tanglewood (gate on
  the north fork) with the game's densest resources (3 iron + trout) and
  toughest overworld spawns. Open PvP with anti-grief (`shared/systems/pvp.ts`,
  6 tests + PVP_ZONES): **level band** (±15), **spawn protection** (10s on
  join/respawn, broken by attacking, blocked attacks don't skull), **skulls**
  (aggressor flagged 5min, synced `skullUntil`; defending vs a skulled player
  doesn't skull). **Death in the zone drops the 3 most valuable items + all
  coins** (pure `deathDrops`, ledgered `pvp_death`, ground loot owned by the
  killer). 161 unit + 33 e2e (duel.spec + ashreach.spec).
- P9 exit (the risk-reward debate among players) needs real players — deferred
  with deploy.

## P10 — the retention layer (complete, local)
- **P10.1 Hunts** (flagship): Huntmaster Veyra assigns data-driven kill tasks
  (6 families, count ranges, point payouts); tagger-only kill credit;
  completion pays Hunt points; point shop (potion/iron sword/relic/Cinderheart,
  ledgered `hunt_shop`). Pure rollHunt/recordHuntKill (tests). Persisted
  (migration `add_retention`); full solo parity. GM `/weaken [id]` test hook.
- **P10.2 Achievements + titles**: data-driven checks (level/total/quest/any),
  pure evaluation; SetTitle validated server-side against a fresh snapshot;
  synced `PlayerSchema.title`; persisted.
- **P10.3 Ironman**: registration checkbox → permanent Account flag carried in
  the JWT; ironmen can't trade (either direction) or use the Exchange;
  hiscores rows carry the flag (⚒ on the HTML board).
- **P10.4 build share codes — deferred**: there is no build system yet
  (abilities are fixed; no talents/loadouts), so a "build template" has
  nothing to encode. Revisit when builds exist.
- 165 unit + 36 e2e (hunt/achievements/ironman specs). P10 exit ("weekly
  actives return") needs real players — deferred with deploy.

## P11 — comfort & reach (complete, local)
- **P11.1 mounts**: buy once at Bran the Stabler (500c sink, migration
  add_mount + persisted flag), ride at 1.6× (M key / dialogue), auto-dismount
  on attack/death, synced + rendered, full solo parity. GM /resetmount,
  /setlevel.
- **P11.2 fast travel**: waystone network (shared/data/waystones.ts, one per
  safe hub at each zone's `default` entry). Click a waystone → menu → 30c fee
  sink (ledger fast_travel) → zone transfer to the destination stone. Reuses
  the gate-transfer handoff; **the fee is now persisted before the handoff**
  (new snapshotFor helper) so the destination room can't load a pre-charge
  snapshot and refund it — a real fix for any charge-then-transfer. Solo
  parity. Ashreach excluded (walk into danger).
- **P11.3 PWA**: web manifest + SVG icon + minimal offline service worker
  (public/, registered PROD+http only; stripped from the single-file build).
  Verified: manifest valid/served/linked, SW registers, no errors.
- **P11.4 load test**: 20 concurrent bots × 25s on the grown schema — 20/20
  connected, 20 joins, zero server errors. (Left ~20 guest rows in the dev DB;
  documented cost of the harness.)
- Capacitor native wrapper + true AOI/interest-management are **deferred**:
  the PWA covers "installable on a phone" without a native toolchain, and AOI
  only matters at populations a single Fly machine won't see pre-scale.
- 165 unit + 38 e2e. P11 exit (mobile session; instant hub hops) met locally.

## P12 — the mountain top (complete, local) → **v1.0**
- **P12.1 the Molten Throne**: instanced 8-player raid past the Ashreach. Five
  chain-spawned telegraphed bosses (48→60) ordered by `shared/data/raid.ts`;
  the Molten King awards the Blade of the Molten King (best-in-slot relic)
  once per character per week (`raidLockUntil` persisted, migration add_raid,
  ledgered `raid_relic`; pure chain/lockout logic + tests). GM `/raidreset`.
  Full solo parity.
- **P12.2 the Proving Grounds**: structured team PvP. Queue at Battlemaster
  Kor (or anywhere via message) → the matchmaker pops a match at two, minting
  a dungeon ticket and red/blue teams (synced `PlayerSchema.team`) → a
  symmetric arena where only cross-team hits land (no bands/skulls/loss) →
  kills score → first to 3 wins 150 coins each (ledgered faucet) → all home.
- **P12.3 world events v1**: scheduled zone invasions (15-min timer in
  greenreach/tanglewood, GM `/invasion` to force): an Invasion Herald
  mini-boss + 4 escorts storm the gate; slaying the herald repels the event
  and scatters the warband. Full solo parity (timer + command).
- 176 unit + 41 e2e (raid/battleground/invasion specs).

# 🏔 v1.0 (local build) — 2026-07-13
Every roadmap phase P0–P12 is built and verified: combat, five skills,
quests, social (friends/parties/guilds/hiscores), a leveling world with a
dungeon + raid, a full economy (trade, Exchange, sinks, dashboard), opt-in
PvP (duels/Ashreach/battleground), retention (hunts/achievements/ironman),
comfort (mounts/fast travel/PWA), and world events. The "best of every MMO"
pitch holds at this scale. Outstanding to call it v1.0 *live*: a paid game
server (Fly trial ended) + making the repo public for the Pages link — both
user decisions. The single-file solo build is the play-test channel.

## ART pass (2026-07-14) — the art-direction overhaul (commit ade2100)
- New procedural art kit (`client/src/render/artkit.ts`): the entire visual
  identity painted at runtime (no image files — the single-file build stays
  self-contained). Per-zone terrain palettes, painted grass/roads/flagstone/
  rock/facades/canopies, flowing water overlay, humanoid hero puppets with a
  two-frame walk cycle + mounts, one authored silhouette per mob family +
  per-boss bodies with auras, zone atmospheres (vignette/fog/particles),
  landmark glows, combat/level-up/gather VFX, and an ember-gold themed UI +
  title screen. Presentation-only: collision, hit areas, DOM contracts, and
  test APIs unchanged.
- Audit finds fixed: ChatBox sticky focus (Enter re-focused the input via the
  window hotkey — since P1.5); achievements.spec pinned GM melee level
  (fixture drift had unlocked melee_40).
- 176 unit + 41 e2e green; single-file rebuilt + file:// verified + resent.
- Steam prep note: a desktop wrapper (Electron/Tauri) + Steamworks SDK,
  store-page assets, and the $100 app fee are the remaining trail — see the
  session notes; the game itself is content-complete and now presentable.

## Steam package (2026-07-14)
- `desktop/` Electron wrapper (sandboxed, contextIsolation, smoke-verified
  `Emberfall.exe` via `EMBERFALL_SMOKE=1` → SMOKE_OK); electron-builder
  `--dir` output `release/win-unpacked` is the SteamPipe depot as-is.
- `steam/`: 7 capsules at exact Steam sizes + 6 1920×1080 screenshots
  (generated from styled HTML via Playwright) + `STEAM.md` runbook with
  store copy. Blocked on the user's Steamworks account + $100 app fee.
- Store-shot pass surfaced and fixed a latent P1.3 bug: Phaser reuses scene
  instances on `scene.start()`, so stale per-zone fields blanked the world
  after zone transfer — all per-zone state now resets in `init()`.

## Play-test round PT.1–PT.5 (2026-07-14/15) — first real user feedback
- **PT.1 fixes** (commit 13dc0ea): misses now broadcast + gray "Miss" float
  ("attacks not registering" was silent whiffs); duplicate gear rows in the
  inventory panel (constructor re-inserted per scene restart); Dorin's quest
  refused because the required sword was *equipped* — turn-in now auto-unequips
  and dialogue/quest views count equipped items (`withEquipped`); death now
  costs 15 durability on all equipped gear (except in the battleground);
  dying in a dungeon/raid ejects you to the overworld gate (Broodmother was
  camping the respawn); dialogue shows per-objective progress counts.
- **PT.2**: +N item-gain toasts on gather/loot/buy; HUD stat hover tooltips.
- **PT.3**: 6-step tutorial on first launch with Skip; replayable from
  Settings (`mmo:tutorial-done`).
- **PT.4**: Settings page — rebindable action keys (conflict-swap, reserved
  movement keys), damage-number + particle toggles, persisted per browser.
- **PT.5 skill tree**: melee perk tiers at levels 5/15/30, one permanent
  either-or pick per tier (Berserker +15% STR / Guardian +15% DEF ·
  Quickblade −10% GCD / Vampiric heal-on-hit · Executioner +30% vs low HP /
  Juggernaut +40 maxHp); respec burns 200 coins (ledger `respec`). Pure
  systems in `shared/systems/perks.ts` (tested); server applies perks only at
  existing seams (playerStats/maxHp/GCD/hit resolution, PvE + PvP); K opens
  the PerksPanel; full solo parity; `perks.spec.ts` e2e ready.
- **PT.5 status**: 182 unit green, typecheck clean, solo single-file rebuilt +
  headless-verified (choose/gate/respec/persist). ⚠ Migration
  `20260714120000_add_perks` is **pending on Neon** — run
  `npm run db:deploy -w @mmo/server`, then the full e2e suite (the server
  can't load players until the column exists).

- **PT.6 (2026-07-16)** — second play-test report, both symptoms fixed:
  - "Frozen after settings" had TWO roots: (a) rebinding a key crashed the
    update loop every frame (`this.keys` only registers key objects at scene
    create; `JustDown(this.keys[newKey])` read `_justDown` off undefined) —
    onChange now registers new keys live (+addCapture), rebinds apply
    immediately; (b) closing the panel mid-rebind ("press…") leaked the
    capture-phase window keydown listener which swallowed every keystroke
    forever — a cancelListen handle now runs on toggle-off/destroy, and
    reserved keys show "reserved — try another" instead of eating input
    silently. Gear button blurs after click (Space=attack re-opened it).
  - "Forge clicks do nothing": material-less rows are disabled buttons and
    the art-pass hover glow made them look clickable — rows now show
    per-material have/need ("Copper Ore 1/1 + Tin Ore 0/1", missing in red),
    disabled rows grey out, hover glow is :enabled-only.
  - All verified headless against the rebuilt single-file (commit 433a975).
- **PT.7 (2026-07-16)** — crafting was dead to REAL mouse clicks all along:
  the update loop calls `craftPanel.setLevels()` every frame while open and
  it re-rendered unconditionally, rebuilding the row buttons 60×/s — a human
  click's mousedown target was destroyed before mouseup, so no click event
  ever fired. e2e/probes never caught it because JS `el.click()` bypasses
  hit-testing. Fix: change-guard in setLevels (audited the other per-frame
  setters: perks guarded, ability bar style-only, HUD lastHud-guarded).
  **LESSON: verify UI click paths with trusted pointer events (Playwright
  `page.click`), never `element.click()` — same class as the "screenshot-
  verify transfers" lesson.**
- **2026-07-17** — `add_perks` migration applied to Neon (user-directed
  `db:deploy`); FULL e2e suite green post-play-test round: **182 unit +
  42 e2e** (perks.spec included — tier gating, sibling rejection,
  juggernaut +40 maxHp, 200c respec sink all pass against the live server).

- **PT.8 (2026-07-16)** — "can't pick up drops until the mob respawns": the
  corpse kept its interactive hit area (setAlive only dimmed it) and its
  pointerdown stopPropagation'd, eating every click on the pile beneath it.
  Fix: disableInteractive on death / re-enable on respawn. Plus walk-over
  auto-pickup for YOUR drops (client sends Pickup within PICKUP_RANGE;
  canAdd precheck, 1s throttle; public piles stay click-to-take). The P3.3
  "auto walk-over pickup deferred" item is now done. Verified headless:
  kill → drop lands in bag with zero clicks, corpse input disabled.

- **PT.9 (2026-07-17)** — economy retune after "mount in 5–10 minutes":
  quest arc paid 440c (88% of a mount) and bandits 10–30c/kill; PT.8's
  auto-pickup also removed the loot friction the old numbers leaned on.
  Data-only: quest coins 440→200 total, trash coins ~¼ (bandit 2–6 etc.),
  Warden 400–800→150–300; raid/invasion (time-gated), item drops, sell
  values, and sink prices unchanged. Target: mount ~40–60 min in, early
  farm ~20–25c/min. Repo now PUBLIC + Pages workflow in use — re-run the
  Pages workflow after balance pushes to update the live build.

- **PT.10 (2026-07-17)** — accuracy + the REAL coin printer. (1) Combat:
  OSRS curve = ~48% hit at even stats → felt broken at 1.5s GCD; new
  `PLAYER_ACCURACY_BONUS` +30pts (cap 95%) on PLAYER attacks only via
  `resolveAttack(..., accuracyBonus)` (mobs keep the raw curve — incoming
  damage unchanged). Even-match now ~80-92%, under-leveled still ~73%↓.
  (2) PT.9 nerfed mob coins but the user's money actually came from
  mine→smelt→sell: iron_bar (value 30, one 3s ore, instant smelt) printed
  ~150c/min. Gear now sells at 15% (`GEAR_BUYBACK_RATE`), iron_ore 10→8,
  iron_bar 30→12, bronze_bar 12→8. Honest rates: ~20-25c/min early,
  ~40-50c/min iron-tier. 185 unit (+3) green. **LESSON: ask the player
  WHERE the money came from before tuning; ledger reasons would have
  shown it (economy dashboard exists — check it next time).**

## P13 — combat expansion (WORLD.md Phase 2 lands in code)
- **P13.1 (2026-07-17, commit 595d616)** — foundation: skills 6→8
  (**Ranged**, **Magic**; migration `add_ranged_magic` APPLIED); weapon
  classes via pure `shared/systems/weapons.ts` (governingSkill /
  basicAbilityFor / abilityKitFor / canUseWithWeapon); 8 new weapons
  (axes/daggers = melee stat spreads; shortbow/longbow; ember/cinder
  staff) sourced from Bram (entry 25c), Tanglewood drops (fine 4–5%), and
  new smithing recipes; 4 new abilities (quick/aimed shot, cinderbolt/
  ember burst); server derives attack/strength from the governing skill
  (defence stays melee-trained), routes kill XP per contributor by the
  skill they last hit with, and weapon-gates UseAbility; client bar swaps
  kits on weapon change (1/2/3 + Space follow); HUD/hiscores/quests know
  the new skills; full solo parity. 190 unit + targeted e2e 5/5 + solo
  probe (kit swap, gate refusal, ranged/melee XP split, persistence).
- **P13.2 (2026-07-18, commit 8d41afa)** — movesets + status effects:
  pure `shared/systems/effects.ts` (applyEffect/tickEffects/moveMultOf,
  1s DoT cadence, exact advertised totals, same-source refresh). Axe kit
  = Strike/**Rend** (1.6× + 9 bleed over 6s); dagger = Strike/
  **Hamstring** (1.3× + 40% slow 4s, scales mob chase speed); Ember
  Burst burns (12 over 6s). Server ticks effects each sim step (DoT
  CombatEvents = free floating numbers), died-block extracted into
  killEnemy() so DoT deaths share exact kill credit/XP routing; PvP DoTs
  land on players (slows deferred until player-speed scaling); solo
  parity. 195 unit; e2e 6/6; probe: one Rend bled a wolf 35→29 with no
  further attacks.
- **P13.3 (2026-07-19, commit 4830335)** — **Callings**: six class trees
  (Warden/Reaver/Strider/Cinderwright/Hearthmender/Ashwalker) on the
  classless chassis. 72 data nodes (12/calling, 24 ranks/tree), tier
  gates every 3 spent points, points = 40% of highest combat level (20
  at cap — trees can't be maxed, choices compete). Pure
  `systems/callings.ts` appliers: stat %, flat HP, GCD, lifesteal,
  execute, **crit (1.5×, capped 50%)**, energy cost, heal power — wired
  at the same server+solo seams as the perk trunk (which survives below
  the tree as the Fighter's Trunk). Choose free once; abandoning costs
  500c (ledger `calling_respec`). Migration `add_callings` APPLIED. K
  panel = calling cards → three-column tree w/ rank pips + tier
  tooltips. 203 unit; probe verified choose-via-real-click, rank cap,
  tier gate, instant +8 maxHp, exact 500c respec, reload persistence.
- Next: cap 50→60 once high-band P14 zones exist.

## P14 — the continent grows (WORLD.md Phase 3 lands in code)
- **P14.1 (2026-07-19, commit 0663f18)** — **The Marrowgate Downs** (10–18):
  first new overworld zone. 60×60 chalk barrow-downs north of Greenreach
  (new north gate + lane); sealed ghost-town landmark (gates barred from
  the inside — dungeon reserved for P14.2); the **Unreturned** mob family
  (Barrow Wisp 9 / Unreturned Wanderer 13 / Marrow Warden 17 w/ rare
  iron-dagger) + grave_wax material; Quartermaster Hale + 2-quest arc
  (quest count 6→8); two iron rocks (band matches mining 10), copper,
  trout, waystone; chalk palette + cold ash-snow atmosphere + authored
  hooded-ghost silhouettes ×3. maps.test auto-covers the JSON. 207 unit;
  e2e 4/4 targeted; probe: spawn/farm/quest/gate-walk with screenshot-
  verified render on BOTH sides of the transfer. PROBE GOTCHA (relearned):
  boot zone lives in localStorage "mmo:zone", not just the solo save.

- **P14.2 (2026-07-19, commit 989446d)** - **The Refused Column** dungeon
  (10-18) + **solo playtest cheats**. 30x50 carved barrow-road under
  Marrowgate (entry via a newly opened barrow in the Downs SW); boss the
  **Gatewright** (lvl 19, telegraphed slam, drops the Barrow Lantern rare
  amulet); third Hale quest completes the arc (9 quests). Solo dungeon
  eject generalized to isDungeonId (was hardcoded cinder_depths||RAID).
  Cheats: Settings gains a solo-only section (max skills / coins / kit /
  mount / heal / raid reset + one-click travel everywhere) on new sandbox
  commands (/maxme /setlevel /setskill /goto /raidreset /mount) that live
  ONLY in localRoom. 211 unit; probe via real clicks: cheats land, travel
  into the dungeon, boss down w/ telegraph damage taken, gate back out.

- **P14.3 (2026-07-19, commit 0300980)** - **The Vossmere** (18-26):
  the drowned Vossari coast south of Tanglewood (new south gate). The Oar
  Wall landmark stands unreachable in open water; stilt-city platform +
  plank bridges to the salvage flats. Mobs: Quenchclaw Crab / Salt-Shade /
  Wreck-Looter. Cooking gets crab meat -> Dressed Crab (heal 55, first new
  recipe since P4). Charterwright Essa + 2 quests (11 total). Two trout
  runs + shrimp + iron/tin + waystone; brine palette + sea mist; cheats
  travel grid updated. Sunken Pyre dungeon reserved for a later slice.
  215 unit; probe: cheat-travel in, crab->meat->cooked, Essa quest, gate
  walk to Tanglewood rendered both sides.

- **P14.4 (2026-07-21, commit a26de55)** - **The Dolmholt** (26-34):
  Dolm mountain holds north of Tanglewood (own lane at cols 32-33 - the
  first gate attempt collided with the Ashreach breach at 26-27, caught by
  the mapgen validator). Terraces climb to the Doors of the Sealed Shift
  (walk-in alcove landmark; dungeon later). Mobs: Scree Hound / Open-Vein
  Cutter / Deep Echo. THE SECOND BANK (the hold vault - one banks.ts data
  line). Rite-Keeper Brunna + 2 quests (13 total). Mining capital: 3 iron
  + 2 copper + tin + tarn trout; waystone; granite palette + snowfall;
  cutter/echo silhouettes. Full e2e sweep 42/42 BEFORE this zone. 219
  unit; probe: cheat-travel, bank round-trip, cutter kill, quest, gate
  descent rendered both sides.

- **P14.5 (2026-07-21, commit 264f808)** - **The Cinderfen** (30-38):
  the steam-fen scar east of the Dolmholt. Glass Willow walk-in landmark;
  sealed Bleedworks (dungeon later - the faction collision point). Mobs:
  Fen Creeper / Glass Stalker / Harvest Enforcer (Order muscle). Fen
  Amber material; Tender Ilse + 2 quests (15 total); 2 scar-iron + copper
  + warm trout pool; waystone; sick-green palette + RISING steam; three
  authored silhouettes; travel cheat updated. 223 unit; probe:
  cheat-travel, creeper kill + pickup, quest, west-gate crossing rendered
  both sides.

## P15 — combat depth (play-test round 4: bosses, tree, gear, AOE, numbers)
- **P15.1 (2026-07-21, commit c901471)** — RAID TRAP FIX: the Molten
  Throne entry hall was never connected to Arena 1 (row 63 solid since
  P12.1; players fought the Broodmother through the wall). Doorway added;
  LESSON: probes must WALK new instanced maps, never tp. BOSS MECHANICS:
  data-driven BossMechanics on MobDef (add waves / enrage / blink /
  burning touch / telegraph volleys) interpreted by server + solo; all 7
  telegraph bosses assigned distinct kits; boss adds die for good;
  mechanics.test.ts guards the content. Solo /weaken [pct] + cheat button
  for threshold testing. FINDING for P15.5: bare-cap DPS ~6/GCD vs a
  2000 HP raid boss — endgame numbers genuinely mis-scaled.
- **P15.2 (2026-07-21, commit 573ff03)** — PASSIVE WEB: PoE-style shared
  graph (~100 nodes, data/web.ts) replaces the six siloed Calling trees.
  Six sectors + center ring + rim links = one connected web; each Calling
  enters at a distinct gate (WEB_STARTS); allocate any node adjacent to an
  owned one. Allocation moved to adjacency (systems/callings.ts
  isReachable), canSpendTalent signature kept so NO netcode/persistence
  changed; pruneToWeb drops stale ids on load; all combat-seam appliers
  unchanged. K panel is a pannable SVG (drag/click), gold=owned blue=open
  grey=distant, keystones/notables labeled; Calling offered from level 1.
  Old 72-node tiered TALENTS retired. 226 unit; probe: allocate/adjacency/
  effects/respec/persist + screenshot.
- **P15.3 (2026-07-22, commit f2bc9bd)** — GEAR EXPANSION: legs/hands/feet/
  ring were EMPTY; now every slot has multiple items via VARIED channels.
  Leather set (beast drops + quest), iron set (smithing + humanoid drops),
  the maul weapon class (was unwielded), rings, and 8 BOSS UNIQUES (one
  per boss, endgame-chunky → feeds P15.5): Broodmother Carapace, Colossus
  Greaves, Shade-Step Boots, Herald Gauntlets, Molten Crown (relic),
  Cinderheart Signet, Gatewright Keyring, Deepdelver Band. 4 quest gear
  rewards + hunt-shop additions + 5 higher hunt tasks + smithing recipes.
  231 unit (+6 gear coverage); probe: slots equip/raise HP, maul wields,
  Broodmother dropped her Carapace.
- **P15.4 (2026-07-22, commit a21ef1c)** — AOE ABILITIES + 4-slot bar.
  Per weapon class: Whirlwind (sword/maul self r96), Fan of Knives
  (dagger self r84), Volley (bow target r96), Scorchwave (staff target
  r104 + burn). AbilityDef.aoe {radius, atTarget?}; new resolveAoe runs
  the full single-hit pipeline (accuracy/execute/crit/lifesteal/effect/
  contributor/killEnemy) vs every enemy in the blast, server + solo
  identical; ids snapshotted so killEnemy is safe mid-loop. Bar → 4 slots
  (ability4 key, default 4); self-centered AOE needs no target. 231 unit,
  e2e 6/6; probe: sword 4-slot bar, Whirlwind hit a wolf pack, Volley hit
  an emberling pack.
- **P15.5 (2026-07-22, commit 87b4d8a)** — ENDGAME DAMAGE SCALING.
  resolveAttack gains optional damageMult; playerDamageMult(level) =
  1 + level*0.08 (L1 1.08x → L50 5x), applied ONLY to player attacks
  (PvE + AOE, server + solo), reading the governing skill level. Mobs
  stay at 1x (incoming damage unchanged); PvP excluded (no one-shots).
  Stacks with gear/web/perks/specials/crit/AOE. Measured: L50 Strike
  now hits up to 77 (was ~15 cap; 38x a level-1 rookie), early game
  intact. Boss HP unchanged — the boost fixes the ratio. 234 unit.
  **P15 ROUND COMPLETE** (all 5 play-test asks: raid trap + boss
  mechanics, PoE web, gear, AOE, big numbers).

## P16 — the endgame ladder
- **P16.1 (2026-07-22, commit b518d45)** — **The Graywastes** (44-52) +
  **LEVEL CAP 60**. Frost steppe east of the Ashreach (east gate; north
  belongs to the raid): Cold Beacon landmark (black lamp, mystery 2-of-9),
  six open-door homesteads, hot-spring trout, cache camps. Mobs: Frost
  Wight / Cache-Reaver / Beacon Congregant (drops Shard of the Beacon
  rare amulet). Cache-Factor Merrin + 2 quests (17 total); iron/copper/
  trout + waystone; frost palette + heavy snow. Cap raise = one constant;
  passive points now 24 at cap; damage mult tops at 5.8x; raid bosses
  (53-60) properly levelable. 238 unit; probe: maxme→60, 24 web points,
  wight died in 5 swings, quest, both-side gate render.
- **P16.2 (2026-07-22, commit 97b3870)** — **The Kindlecourt** (48-56):
  the shattered capital south of the Graywastes. Scaffold of the
  Everlasting Lamp (walk-in engine floor); sealed Lamplight Archive
  (raid-lead-in dungeon later); five breached insulae + forum +
  colonnades + cistern. Mobs: Unreturned Courtier / Court Sentinel /
  Archive Warden (55 elite, drops the LAMPLIGHTER STAFF — first rare
  chase weapon). Docent Havel + 2 quests incl. the first MAGIC-XP
  reward (19 total); Lamp Glass; iron/copper/cistern trout; waystone;
  2 endgame hunt tasks; burnt-marble palette + ember motes + 3 authored
  painters. 242 unit; probe: travel in, lvl-55 warden killed at cap,
  quest, both-side gate render.
- **P16.3 (2026-07-22, commit 4bb5f86)** — **The Emberheart Caldera**
  (52-60): the Wound itself — **THE 1-60 WORLD IS COMPLETE**. Wound-column
  in a lava ring; the Last Camp truce; the raid gate MOVED INTO the zone
  (Ashreach R gate → caldera; Molten Throne exit + return zone → caldera
  floor). Mobs: Cinder Husk / Wound Wraith / Throne Herald (drops
  Wound-Walker Boots, relic feet). Camp-Keeper Ashka + 2 quests incl.
  first RANGED-XP reward (21 total); Ember Tears; richest iron (no
  fishing — lava); Last Camp waystone; lava palette + fast embers; 3
  painters. maps.test caught a patch-of-patch exit regression mid-slice.
  246 unit; probe: travel/kill-59-at-cap/quest/FULL raid chain both ways.
## P17 — the promised dungeons
- **P17.1 (2026-07-22, commit fdc0daf)** — **The Sunken Pyre** (18-26):
  the Vossmere dungeon. Barnacled hatch on the salvage flats → 30×50
  wreck-reef crawl (listing hold, fused decks, pyre heart). Boss the
  PYRE ADMIRAL (26, telegraph volley ×2 + salt-shade adds at 60/30% via
  the P15.1 mechanics system; drops the OARBLADE rare sword — the
  mid-band chase weapon). Essa quest 3 closes the arc (22 quests).
  Coastal trash reused; authored Admiral painter; drowned palette.
  250 unit; probe: Admiral + adds confirmed, loot, hatch both ways.
- **The continent: 10 zones + 5 instances, contiguous 1-60.** Left from
  WORLD.md: Greatwake Isles (34-42 side zone) + dungeons (Sealed Shift /
  Bleedworks / Lamplight Archive).

## Known follow-ups (deferred, not blocking)
- **Controls feel "wonky"** (user feedback) — prediction/reconciliation +
  camera tuning. Polish during/after P1.3 rendering work.
- **Phone stray-path 404** ("Cannot GET /Can" from URL autocomplete) — fixed
  with an SPA fallback in server/src/index.ts; ships with the next deploy.
  Bare URL https://emberfall-server.fly.dev already works on mobile.
- **Server uptime**: Fly still stops the idle machine despite auto_stop=false;
  mitigated by client wake-and-retry + keepwarm cron. If it recurs, consider
  moving prisma migrate out of boot (release_command) for fast cold starts.

## Shipped

### 2026-06-26 — P6 social fabric complete ✅ (P6.1–P6.5)
- **Whispers** `/w name text` (cross-zone via the bus, censored + throttled).
- **Friends + presence** (persisted list, cap 50; process-local presence
  service with a transfer-safe unregister guard).
- **Parties + shared XP** (pure PartyRegistry, cap 5, leader promotion; roster
  fan-out via the bus; same-zone/level-range shared kill XP; loot stays
  tag-based).
- **Guilds v1** (durable: Guild table + membership on Player; ranks
  leader/officer/member with a pure permission matrix; transient invites;
  leadership hand-off + disband-when-empty; members-only guild chat channel;
  snapshots never write membership so kicks can't be clobbered).
- **Public hiscores** (/hiscores HTML + /api/hiscores JSON; per-skill + total).
- 128 unit + 24 e2e; typecheck clean. Migrations: add_friends, add_guilds.
- All social fan-out goes through globalBus/presence/parties seams → the P11
  Redis swap stays a services-layer change.

### 2026-06-24 — P4.3 rested XP (P4 complete) ✅
- WoW-style rested buffer: offline time banks credit (`restedAccrual`, capped)
  that adds +50% to every XP award until spent (`restedBonus`); both pure +
  unit-tested. `restedXp` synced + persisted (migration `add_rested_xp`),
  accrued on join from prior `lastSeen` (loadOrCreate reworked to read-then-
  write). Applied to combat + gathering + crafting XP. HUD 💤 indicator. 103
  unit + 16 e2e. **P4 COMPLETE** — the RuneScape skilling heart is in.

### 2026-06-24 — P4.2 crafting (Smithing + Cooking) + food healing ✅
- Two crafting skills (synced + persisted XP, migration `add_crafting_skills`).
  Recipes are data (smelt bronze/iron, forge bronze sword/helm, cook shrimp/
  trout). Pure `craft()` (4 unit tests). `Craft` is instant + ledgered (inputs
  destroyed, output created); `Consume`/eat removes food and heals (green +N).
  Client crafting panel (toggle C) + click-food-to-eat in the bag; HUD 🔨/🍳.
  98 unit + 16 e2e (new craft.spec: smelt bronze bar + Smithing XP; cook + eat).
  P4 exit met: mine → smith a bronze sword → cook a fish → fight, no drops
  needed. (Deferred: crafting stations, timed/auto-repeat crafts, gathering
  tools — all noted as polish; craft is instant + station-free for v1.)

### 2026-06-19 — P4.1 gathering (Mining + Fishing) ✅
- Two gathering skills with synced+persisted XP (migration
  `add_gathering_skills`). Resource nodes are data-driven, per-player,
  non-depleting placements (no synced schema — client renders from data, server
  validates), like the bank pattern. `Gather` is a zod message; the server runs
  a ~2.4–3s timed gather that auto-repeats while standing still, yields one
  ledgered item per cycle (reason `gather`) + skill XP, and stops on move /
  range / full bag / level gate. Client node markers + HUD ⛏/🎣 levels +
  level-up toasts. 94 unit + 14 e2e (new gather.spec).

### 2026-06-19 — P3.4 town bank (P3 complete) ✅
- Pure deposit/withdraw (7 unit tests; round-trip conserves totals); `addItem`
  generalized with a slot-cap arg for the 240-slot bank. Bank locations are data
  (`nearBank`); Meadowbrook's bank is in the plaza. Server-authoritative bank,
  off synced state (private Bank message), persisted (Prisma JSONB). Deposit/
  Withdraw zod messages gated by bank proximity; bag↔bank is a transfer so it's
  NOT ledgered (ledger stays balanced). Client bank marker + two-column panel
  (toggle B at a bank). Migration `add_bank`. 94 unit + 13 e2e (new bank.spec:
  /tp to bank → /give → deposit → withdraw round-trip).
- **P3 COMPLETE locally** — items/inventory/equipment/loot/bank + economy ledger.

### 2026-06-19 — P3.3 drop tables + ground loot + coins (personal loot) ✅
- Pure `rollDrops` (5 unit tests) + per-mob drop tables. On kill, every
  contributor gets their own roll (GW2 personal loot) → GroundLootSchema piles
  in synced state, owner-reserved 60s then public, despawn 120s. Pickup is a
  zod message, range + ownership checked server-side; the item is ledgered into
  the economy on pickup (reason `loot`) — unpicked despawned loot is a
  non-event. Client renders clickable piles; GM `/droploot` for testing. No DB
  migration (transient). 87 unit + 12 e2e (new loot.spec: drop → pickup → bag).
- Deviation: ground loot is shared synced state (everyone sees all piles, but
  pickup is owner-gated until the timer) rather than GW2's per-player-invisible
  loot — true filtered visibility needs Colyseus StateView, deferred. Auto
  walk-over pickup also deferred (click-to-pickup for now).

### 2026-06-19 — P3.2 equipment + stat application (+ STORY.md) ✅
- Pure equip/unequip/equipmentBonus system (9 unit tests); 8 gear slots.
  Equipment is server-authoritative, off synced state (private Equipment
  message), persisted (Prisma JSONB). Equip/unequip are zod-validated; the
  server recomputes maxHp (Vitality + gear) and applies gear bonuses to the
  player's effective combat stats as attacker *and* defender. Client equipment
  strip (click to equip/unequip). Migration `add_equipment`. 82 unit + 11 e2e.
- Test note: maxHp is a synced-schema field, so its delta can land just after
  the Equipment message — e2e polls maxHp rather than reading once.
- Wrote `design/STORY.md`: the world (Vesper, the Emberfall), factions, and the
  five-act Main Story spine (Meadowbrook→Greenreach→Tanglewood→Ashreach→Cinder
  Depths) with the central release/bind/tend choice. Narrative source of truth.

### 2026-06-19 — P3.1 items + inventory + economy ledger ✅
- Typed item roster + pure 28-slot stacking inventory (10 unit tests). Inventory
  delivered to its owner via a private `Inventory` message (off synced state),
  persisted as a Prisma JSONB column. Economy ledger (`LedgerEntry`) appends on
  every item create/destroy; GM `/give` is the first audited creation path.
  Client inventory panel (toggle I). Migration `add_inventory_and_ledger`.
- Bugs found + fixed while wiring it up (good lessons):
  - **JSONB read race**: the pg driver-adapter returns the `inventory` JSONB
    column as a *string*, not a parsed array — `parseInventory` now JSON.parses a
    string before validating (position persisted but inventory always loaded []
    until this fix).
  - **Join-race on initial state push**: a `client.send` in `onJoin` can land
    before the client registers its handler and get dropped (Welcome hid this
    because it's a no-op). Added a `RequestInventory` pull the client sends once
    its handlers exist — the reliable pattern for any per-client initial state.
  - **Missing DOM**: added inventory CSS without the `#inventory` markup → the
    panel constructor crashed every scene. (Always add the element, not just CSS.)
  - **Flaky combat e2e**: two-players fired 8 strikes at 250ms but the ~1.5s GCD
    let only ~2 land, and combat is noisy (~60% hit × 0..max damage), so it was
    ~35% likely to register zero damage — it had been passing on luck. Now it
    strikes on a GCD-spaced cadence until damage registers. (Combat itself is
    fine — verified server-side 200→198.)
- 73 unit + 10 e2e green; typecheck clean.

### 2026-06-17 — P2.5 bot harness + GM commands (P2 combat core complete) ✅
- **Bot harness** `tools/bots.ts` (`npm run bots -- --count 50 [--zone …]
  [--server …] [--duration …]`): headless Colyseus SDK clients that guest-auth
  via /auth/guest, join, and steer toward + Strike the nearest mob using the
  same intents a real client sends. Staggered connects, auto-reconnect on drop,
  10s stats heartbeat, graceful SIGINT/duration shutdown. Smoke-verified (4
  bots connect + fight locally). No new deps (reuses @colyseus/sdk + @mmo/shared
  via tsx, like the live-*.mjs tools).
- **GM commands v1**: `/heal [name]`, `/tp <x> <y>`, `/spawn <kind>`, `/kick
  <name>`. Role-gated by `GM_USERNAMES` env allowlist (comma-separated, case-
  insensitive) — set it via `fly secrets set GM_USERNAMES=…` for prod GMs;
  there is deliberately NO DB/GM flag a client could set. Pure parser + role
  check in `@mmo/shared/systems/gm` (unit-tested); effects run server-
  authoritatively in ZoneRoom and are audit-logged to the console. Slash
  messages are intercepted before chat (never broadcast); non-GMs get a private
  "System" refusal.
- 63 unit + 8 e2e green; typecheck clean. New `gm.spec` proves a GM can /spawn
  and a non-GM cannot (Playwright server runs with GM_USERNAMES="GMTest").
- **P2 combat core is functionally complete (local).** Outstanding P2 exit
  bullet is the manual 50-bot/1-hour soak (do against a throwaway Neon branch
  or after deploy is unblocked — bots create guest rows).

### 2026-06-16 — P2.4 XP, leveling & shared kill credit ✅
- `gainXp(currentXp, amount)` on the shared RS curve (clamps negatives, reports
  level + leveledUp) — 5 new unit tests.
- PlayerSchema gains synced `meleeXp` / `vitalityXp`; `level` is now the Melee
  level (drives combat stats), maxHp is derived from the Vitality level. Levels
  are recomputed from XP on join — the saved `level`/`maxHp` columns are
  denormalized convenience only, never trusted.
- ZoneRoom tracks per-mob contributor sets; landing a hit tags you; on death
  every living contributor is awarded full XP (`awardKill` → `grantXp`). A
  Vitality level-up raises maxHp and heals by the delta. Contributors cleared
  on death (after award) and on respawn; pruned on leave.
- `ServerMessage.LevelUp` (+ `LevelUpPayload {skill, level}`) sent only to the
  leveler → gold fading client toast; HUD shows ⚔/♥ levels (Vitality derived
  client-side with the same shared curve). Test API `me()` exposes XP + levels.
- Prisma `add_skills` migration (additive: `meleeXp`/`vitalityXp` Int default 0)
  applied to Neon via `migrate deploy`. 56 unit + 6 e2e green; typecheck clean.
- Exploit pass: XP is fully server-authoritative — it only flows from a real,
  in-range, GCD/energy/cooldown-gated hit resolved server-side, so a client
  can't grant itself XP, levels, or HP. Shared credit only includes sessions
  that actually damaged the mob; leavers are skipped on award (no dup, no
  crash) since their progress already persisted on leave.

### 2026-06-14 — P0 closed + the actual freeze fixed + P1.1/P1.2 ✅
- **Real root cause of "stuck on Entering" found via the user's browser
  console**: `ZoneScene.update()` read `room.state.players.get()` before the
  schema state had streamed in. Sub-ms on localhost (never failed locally),
  but on a remote server the first frames run pre-sync → `undefined.get()`
  throws → render loop freezes on the loading screen. Fixed with a guard in
  update() + optional chaining in the test API. **This was THE bug**; the
  earlier uptime/cold-start work was a separate, real issue.
- Game verified working on the user's desktop against the live server.
- SPA fallback added (server serves index.html for stray GET paths → phones
  that autocomplete a path no longer 404).
- **P1.1**: zod schemas validate every inbound message via Colyseus
  `onMessage(type, schema, handler)`; `maxMessagesPerSecond` flood ceiling.
- **P1.2**: `tools/mapgen` ASCII→Tiled-JSON compiler; Meadowbrook (40×40
  town) + Greenreach (60×60 fields) maps with collision/exits/spawn/enemy
  object layers; pure `systems/collision.ts` (axis-separated slide); 31 unit
  tests green (collision + map referential integrity).

### 2026-06-13 — Cold-start resilience (the real "stuck on Entering" fix) ✅
- Diagnosed via logs: a real player joined fine while the machine was awake,
  then Fly stopped the machine (SIGTERM) despite deployed `auto_stop_machines:
  false`. A websocket join against a stopped machine hangs forever → the
  "stuck on Entering Verdant Vale" the user saw. (So it was infra lifecycle,
  not a code bug — the game itself always worked when the server was up.)
- Two-layer fix: (1) client `connectToZone` wakes the server via HTTP polling
  before joining (the request triggers Fly auto_start), shows progress + a 75s
  budget, BootScene offers tap/key retry; (2) `.github/workflows/keepwarm.yml`
  pings the server every 5 min so it stays awake.
- Verified post-deploy: 1 machine started, live SDK join OK, new bundle
  `index-KribFUb2.js` served. Bundle resilience confirmed shipped.

### 2026-06-12 — One-URL deploy + production crash-loop fix ✅
- **The Fly app now serves the game itself** (express static of client/dist,
  built in-image; client resolves endpoint same-origin). Netlify dependency
  dropped — netlify.toml stays as an optional future path. ONE URL:
  https://emberfall-server.fly.dev
- **Root-caused the production hang** ("stuck on Entering…"): Neon serverless
  kills idle Postgres sockets → pg pool emitted unhandled 'error' → Node
  died → Fly machine stopped → next visitor hit a ~15s cold boot with hanging
  joins. Fixed three ways: own pg.Pool (idleTimeoutMillis 30s + error
  handler), 4-min SELECT 1 heartbeat (also prevents Neon free-tier compute
  suspend), process-level uncaught/unhandled guards, and fly.toml
  `[[restart]] policy="always"`.
- Live verification over the real internet: matchmake 200 ✓, raw WS upgrade +
  join handshake ✓ (tools/live-ws-probe.mjs), full Node SDK join ✓
  (tools/live-join.mjs). NOTE: the local sandboxed Chromium cannot execute
  external-HTTPS page scripts (bodies stall) — browser-level live checks must
  run on a real device; identical bundle verified end-to-end via LAN origin
  (tools/live-smoke.mjs against http://<lan-ip>:2567).
- Docker gotchas fixed: tsconfig.base.json must be COPYd (extends chain);
  image builds client with vite only (tsc stays the local/CI gate).
- New deps: express (static hosting), pg + @types/pg (owned pool).

### 2026-06-10 — P0 production plumbing ✅
- **Prisma 7 persistence** replaces the JSON snapshot store: `Player` table,
  SQLite locally (`server/prisma/dev.db`, no Docker needed), driver-adapter
  setup (`@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3`), `db:migrate`/`db:studio`/
  `db:deploy`/`db:generate` scripts, root `postinstall` generates the client.
  Async store with fault-tolerant snapshot writes. All tests green against
  the DB (14 unit + 2 e2e incl. reconnect persistence).
- **git repo initialized**, initial commit; `.gitignore` covers env/db/
  generated client.
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — typecheck + unit tests on push.
- **Deploy prep:** `server/Dockerfile` (workspace-aware, migrate-on-boot),
  `fly.toml`, `.dockerignore`, `server/.env.example`, runbook at
  `design/DEPLOY.md`. Client already reads `VITE_SERVER_URL`.
- New runtime deps (rule 9): `@prisma/client` + `@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3`
  (persistence), `tsx` moved to deps (prod runtime executes TS directly).
  Dev deps: `prisma`, `dotenv` (prisma.config.ts env loading).

### 2026-06-09 — M0/P0 local slice ✅
- npm-workspaces monorepo (`shared`/`server`/`client`), strict TS everywhere
- Colyseus 0.17 zone room: 20 Hz authoritative sim, movement intents
  validated/clamped server-side, tab-target ability vs training dummy
- Phaser 3 client: prediction + reconciliation (local), interpolation
  (remote), nameplates, health bars, click-to-target, R to attack
- Reconnect restores character (JSON snapshot store, keyed by playerId)
- 14 Vitest unit tests (combat/movement) + 2 Playwright e2e (two-player sync,
  persistence); typecheck clean across all workspaces

### 2026-06-10 — Design reconciliation ✅
- Emberfall starter kit (7/9 docs recovered) merged into `design/`:
  GDD, ROADMAP (P0–P12 + exit criteria), INSPIRATION_MAP, WORKFLOW, this log,
  and repo `CLAUDE.md`. Kit's BOOTSTRAP is obsolete (scaffold exists);
  kit's ARCHITECTURE.md was not recovered and is superseded by the working
  repo + CLAUDE.md rules.

## Decision log

- **2026-06-11 — Postgres EVERYWHERE (Neon), SQLite dropped.** Deviation from
  DEPLOY.md §2's "SQLite locally / PG in prod": Prisma 7 driver adapters
  declare a provider that must match the schema provider, so one schema can't
  serve both engines. Local dev + prod now share the same Neon DB (split into
  a Neon branch for dev when it starts to matter). Local dev requires
  internet — acceptable for an online game. `@prisma/adapter-better-sqlite3`
  removed; `@prisma/adapter-pg` added; `dotenv` promoted to runtime dep
  (db.ts loads server/.env).

- **2026-06-10 — REAL-TIME 20 Hz LOCKED** over the kit's 600ms OSRS tick.
  Criteria: most popular modern combat model, least clunky, netcode already
  built and verified; deliberate pacing via ~1.5s GCD (FFXIV), not input
  quantization. Do not reopen.
- **2026-06-10** — Classless skills (8 launch skills, RS-style) supersede the
  M0 `ClassId` placeholder; refactor lands with P2 combat core.
- **2026-06-09** — Colyseus schema via `defineTypes()` + `declare` fields
  (NOT `@type` decorators — tsx/esbuild emits TC39 decorators that crash
  Colyseus). See CLAUDE.md gotchas.
- **2026-06-09** — Phaser pinned to v3 (^3.90) for consistency with the
  user's other projects; npm resolves v4 by default — don't upgrade casually.
- **2026-06-09** — Persistence M0 = JSON snapshots (zero native deps on
  Windows); Prisma/Postgres is the P0-remainder upgrade.

## Known bugs / debt

- Zone is the placeholder `verdant-vale` open grid — replaced by Tiled
  Meadowbrook/Greenreach in P1 (rename `zoneId` then).
- No inbound-message schema validation yet beyond clamping — zod lands P1.
- Migrations are SQLite-flavored; the Postgres swap (provider + adapter-pg +
  regenerated init migration) happens at the deploy session — DEPLOY.md §2.
- Headless-Chromium WebGL doesn't paint into screenshots; `?canvas=1` query
  flag forces the Canvas renderer for visual capture (used by e2e).
